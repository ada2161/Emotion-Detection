# Emotion-Detection

This project is the back-end part of a project developed to detect emotion from speech. We only train the models and put them into the mfcc_train directory and these models are then used to detect speech. The front end is a web-app which uses an ajax call and call the backend server which outputs the emotion which is then displayed.
